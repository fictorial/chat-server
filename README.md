## Client API

### var client = require('chat-server').connect(port, host)

### client methods

#### join('channel')

Join a channel.

#### part('channel', 'why')

#### list(callback)

List all active channels.

#### members('channel', callback)

List all members of a channel. 'callback' is passed an array of
nicknames.

### client events

#### 'server-error' (message)

## Protocol

The client/server protocol is based on CRLF-delimited JSON objects.

### Client Requests

     { "nick": "unique-nickname" }
     { "list": "channel-prefix"  }
     { "join": "channel-name" }
     { "members": "channel-name" }
     { "say": "channel-name", "what": "message" }
     { "part": "channel-name", "why": "reason"  }
     { "info": true }

### Server Responses

A subset of client requests elicit a response.

     { "error": "error-message" }
     { "list": ["channel-name", ...] }
     { "members": "channel-name", "nicks": ["nick", ...] }
     { "info": { "channels": int, "users": int, "uptime": int } }

### Server Notifications

Something happened server-side that the client might be interested in.

     { "join": "channel-name", "who": "nick" }
     { "part": "channel-name", "who": "nick", "why":  "reason"   }
     { "say":  "channel-name", "who": "nick", "what": "message"  }
     { "nick": "channel-name", "old_nick": "nick", "new_nick": "new-nick" }

## Notes

Any client wrongdoing results in an immediate disconnection.

This server does not connect to other servers like a IRC network.
